# SQL-Portfolio-Projects
## Analysis and Engineering using SQL

The datasets include: 

[Minimum Wage](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lislejoem/us-minimum-wage-by-state-from-1968-to-2017)

[Equity in Athletics](https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/#/)

[Custom Report Data](https://knightnewhousedata.org/reports) 

[Cost of Attendance](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/InstitutionByName.aspx?goToReportId=1)


The project includes using several sets of static data files. The data was cleaned using Python. Analysis was performed on datasets and irrelevant data and duplicates were removed. Conversion of data types, number formatting, handling missing information, capitalization and fixing errors were performed. Column names had standardized formatting so they were meaningful across datasets. Since the datasets were unstructured, developing consistency amongst the data was important. After the datasets were transformed, a schema was produced and database was created based off of the schema


## Things I've Learned

* Defining data structures using Data Definition Language (DDL) 

* Create, Drop, Alter and Rename database, tables and attributes 

* Defined constraints in database

* Manipulated data using Data Manipulation Language (DML)

* Imported csv file into Microsoft SQL Server

* Inserted values from csv file into created tables
